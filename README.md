The purpose of this project is to use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the price of two different options, Asian option and European option.
The inputs are: 
S0: Spot price
K: Strike price
r: Interest rate
sigma: Volatility
T: Maturity time
N: Intervals
scenario: Total times we want to simulate for our model
Asian/European: To select an option choice
